As shown in Fig.(b), small bins sizes might introduce artifacts. Fig.(b) and Fig.(c) are examples of histograms with two different bin sizes. Another great way to visualize such distribution is to use a cumulative representation, as shown in Fig.(d), in which the y-axis represents the number of data points with values greater than y. Create the figures (b) and (d) using the data extracted for task 1A. For Fig.(b), represent two histograms using two different bin sizes and provide a brief description of the results.
